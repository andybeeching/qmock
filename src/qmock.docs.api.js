/** section: QMock
 * QMock.create() -> QMock instance
 *
 *  Factory method for instantiating a new QMock instance with separate
 *  state and copies of private/public members
 *
 *  This is potentially useful for running two versions side-by-side with
 *  custom comparison methods, or modifiying any of the public members.
 *
 *  #### Example
 *
 *  <pre><code>QMock.create(); // Object (API)</code></pre>

   *  Configuration settings for QMock - can be modified during runtime.

    /**
     * QMock.config.failslow -> true | Boolean
     *
     *  Allows a developer to specify whether errors built up during a
     *  verify phase should be thrown or suppressed (by default set to
     *  <code>true</code>).
     *
     *  If in 'fail fast' mode (e.g. <code>QMock.config.failslow = false;</code>)
     *  then exceptions are thrown as part of the verify phase, and it is
     *  up to the invoking test runner code to catch and handle them for
     *  assertion.
     *
     *  This can result in scenarios where expected 'good' exercise phase
     *  fails, an exception is thrown, and the testrunner stops due an
     *  unhandled exception.
     *
     *  An alternative (and the default setting) is a 'fail slow' appraoch.
     *  Here, the <code>Mock._getExceptions()</code> method can be called
     *  to see which exceptions were thrown, and inspect their properties.
     *

     *  <code>Boolean</code> value, and be set before any tests are run, or
     *  mock instantiated.

  /**
   * QMock.utils.enumerate( obj, callback [, context] [, bool] ) -> Object
   *  - obj (Object): Object whose properties to enumerate
   *  - callback (Function): Callback function applied to current property. Passed
   *  three parameters, the current property value, the property
   *  identifier (the key) it's associated by on receiver, and the object
   *  (receiver) it is bound to.
   *  - context (Object) _optional_: Object to set as execution context on
   *  callback invocation (i.e. <code>this</code> binding). Defaults to the
   *  <code>obj</code> parameter value.
   *  - bool (Boolean) _optional_: Optional flag to determine enumeration
   *  upon inherited (via [[prototype]]) properties. Default is
   *  <code>false</code>.
   *
   *  This is a helper function inspired by the functional programming
   *  syntactic sugar methods on Array.prototype. It's purpose to provide a
   *  simple mechanism for enumerating over an object interface, and
   *  enacting upon it's properties.
   *
   *  It also aims to fix the broken enumeration in browsers (IE6-8) which
   *  fails to enumerate any keys which shadow natively inherited properties
   *  (even where ES3/5 spec states they should indeed be enumerable).
   *
   *  Currently it's really to ensure <code>toString</code> and
   *  <code>valueOf</code> properties are accessible for enactment
   *  (e.g. copying/invoking/overriding).
   *
   *  The esteemed Garrett Smith has the bullet on DHTMLKitchen.
   *

   *  #### Example

   *
   *  Utility method for testing a known parameter list against a mock's

   *
   *  Can also be used to retrieve associated metadata from an Expectation

   *
   *  #### Returns
   *
   *  * If optional property name is passed then will use that as key
   *  on any matching expectation objects and return the correlating value.
   *  e.g. Internally QMock uses the method to return canned stubbed
   *  responses during an exercise phase. The method can be used as
   *  standalone to test the Stub interface.
   *  * If no property parameter passed then a Boolean value is returned
   *  depending on match success.

  // KLASS DEFINITIONS

  /**
   * == Receiver ==
   *
   *  Receiver mock objects are simply pseudo-namespaces for mocked methods
   *  and stubbed properties.
   *
   *  QMock allows receivers to be either plain old object literals, or
   *  functions (aka smart mocks) depending on the requirement to accurately
   *  replicate a given real-world collaborator object interface (with
   *  associated behaviours).
   **/

  /** section: Receiver
   * class Receiver
   *
   *  Receiver is the central superclass in QMock for the simple reason that
   *  Mock objects (aka functions), can also be receiver mock objects. Hence
   *  the Mock klass (and insatnces) implements the Receiver klass interface.
   *
   *  So if one were to define a Constructor akin to jQuery's <code>$</code>,
   *  they can also still attach member methods and properties to that.
   *
   *  The public interface for both klasses act identically no matter which
   *  type the mock is.

    /**
     * Mock#end() -> Mock
     *
     *  Utility method to end a mock method expectation declaration, or
     *  retrieve the receiver object a mock object is bound to. In other
     *  words it sets the receiver object context for setting new methods,
     *  properties, or namespaces on mock interfaces. It should also be used
     *  as the last item in a mock declaration cascading invocation chain (or
     *  rather wherever the last method is set).
     *
     *  Why? Since functional mocks can also act as receivers / namespaces in
     *  their own right, it allows more fine-grained control over what object
     *  a mock is actually set upon, especially when objects have deep(ish)
     *  hierarchies.
     *
     *  The common use case when setting mocks via cascading invocation is
     *  to set new member mocks on the _same_ receiver, so
     *  <code>mock.end()</code> *must* be used after expectations for a mock
     *  at the same level have been set. This means subsequent mock
     *  declarations are set within the same receiver object context.
     *
     *  Without calling <code>Mock.end()</code> then subsequent mocks are
     *  set on the current mock, and are thus nested at a deeper level.
     *
     *  For this reason it might be less work to set your mocks up by passing
     *  the mock constructor a 'property mapping' (see main Mock docs), and
     *  let the constructor handle the work for you.
     *
     *  _Please note calling <code>Mock.end()</code> does not mean a mock
     *  object cannot be further augmented/manipulated (that would be
     *  <code>Mock.excise()</code>)_.
     *
     *  For the jQuery-conversant, the method acts in part like the
     *  <code>$("..").end()</code> method, which is used to restore the
     *  execution context to a given jQuery 'wrapped set' (thanks Cody!) (as
     *  well as it's original state), post-manipulation (via
     *  $.find()/$.filter()).
     *
     *  #### Example
     *
     *  <pre><code>// Declare nested methods...
     *  var mock = new Mock;
     *  mock.method('foo').method("bar");
     *
     *  // Looks like...
     *  mock = {
     *    foo: { // foo is also a function (functions are first-class citizens too!)
     *      bar: function () {}
     *    }
     *  }
     *
     *  // Declare methods on equal level
     *  // Note last call *required*!! Else mock set to 'bar' mock, not it's
     *  // receiver.
     *  mock.method('foo').end().method("bar").end();
     *
     *  // Looks like...

  /** section: QMock
   *  QMock.Spy() -> Spy
   *
   *  NOTE: This is exposed as <code>Spy()</code> in the containing lexical
   *  scope (default is global) as a convenience. Please see the example code
   *  below.
   *
   *  The Spy constructor/method allows a developer to record interactions
   *  with a given function, without having to completely stub out it's
   *  behaviour. This is a halfway-house solution for ensuring your
   *  collaborator objects are interacting correctly, meaning that during
   *  an exercise phase, the SUT will still be interacting with *real*
   *  functions/constructors.
   *
   *  Spy objects/functions implement the Mock interface, though since the
   *  Spy actually invokes (exercises) a real function, then any declared
   *  return behaviours are made redunadant. That said, the
   *  <code>Mock.verify()</code> method still tests the interface
   *  constraints, i.e. the number of times an espied function was called,
   *  as well as the arguments received against expectations.
   *
   *  While this is a convenient shortcut to setting up glass-box testing
   *  for any domain/business logic orientated invocation, it should be
   *  noted that the resulting test-suite will be less effective, as the
   *  _UNmocked_ collaborator object constitutes a point of failure (as )
   *  it is an unknown.
   *
   *  For more confidence in your tests, be sure to fully mock out
   *  collaborators with _known_ behaviour, to eliminate them as potential
   *  sources of problems.

   *  #### Example
   *
   *  <pre><code>// SUT
   *  var bar = false;
   *
   *  function foo ( bool ) {
   *    bar = bool;
   *  }
   *
   *  // Setup
   *  foo = Spy(foo).calls(1).accepts(true); // expect one call & true
   *
   *  // Exercise
   *  foo( true );
   *
   *  // verify
   *  bar === true // true
   *  foo.verify() // true
   *
   *  foo.reset();
   *  foo( false );
   *  foo.verify() // false - wrong parameter
   *
